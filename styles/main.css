/*This first part of the CSS accomplishes a few things:
Gives the default 'empty' start to each star location
Sets up classes for filled in stars, and highlighted stars
Defines and styles the stars' container.
You can either use the graphics provided in the download, or make your own. There needs to be a graphic for each of the three states: empty, full, and highlighted.
Next we add a little more CSS to position the total votes box, and center the widgets so the page matches the graphic at the start of this section.*/
